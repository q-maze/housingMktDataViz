# Location Affordability Tool 
q-maze, (), ()

## Introduction and Overview
For our CS 5010 semester project, our project group chose to examine data on housing and affordability across the United States. 

## The Data
The dataset we chose is the US Department of Housing and Urban Development's location affordability index. This dataset combines housing affordability data with transportation costs for all localities within the United States.

## Experimental Design

Describe briefly your process, starting from where you obtained your data all the way to means of obtaining results/output. 

## Beyond the original specifications

Highlight clearly what things you did that went beyond the original specifications. That is, discuss what you implemented that would count toward the extra-credit portion of this project (see section below).

## Results

Display and discuss the results. Describe what you have learned and mention the relevance/significance of the results you have obtained.

## Testing 

Describe what testing you did. Describe the unit tests that you wrote. Show a sample run of 1 or 2 of your tests (screen captures or copy-and-paste is fine).

## Conclusions

Summarize your findings, explain how these results could be used by others (if applicable), and describe ways you could improve your program. You could describe ways you might like to expand the functionality of your program if given more time.
