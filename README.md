# Location Affordability Tool 
q-maze, (), ()

## Introduction and Overview
The team was interested in studying housing data for our project and we were able to find census data on affordability ratings of various cities.

## The Data
The dataset we chose is the US Department of Housing and Urban Development's location affordability index. This dataset combines housing affordability data with transportation costs for all localities within the United States.

## Experimental Design

Describe briefly your process, starting from where you obtained your data all the way to means of obtaining results/output. 

The data is mainly broken down by specific indices of affordability like transportation, renting, transit, etc. as well as the data at different income levels.Â 

## Beyond the original specifications

Highlight clearly what things you did that went beyond the original specifications. That is, discuss what you implemented that would count toward the extra-credit portion of this project (see section below).

We were looking to make this an affordability recommendation engine that based on specific criteria the data can help provide a list of options that fit the user.

## Results

Display and discuss the results. Describe what you have learned and mention the relevance/significance of the results you have obtained.

List out the top 10 places to live based on average affordability data.

## Testing 

Describe what testing you did. Describe the unit tests that you wrote. Show a sample run of 1 or 2 of your tests (screen captures or copy-and-paste is fine).

There will need to be a lot of testing around user input catching incorrect inputs and counter with corrections or recommendations.

## Conclusions

Summarize your findings, explain how these results could be used by others (if applicable), and describe ways you could improve your program. You could describe ways you might like to expand the functionality of your program if given more time.
